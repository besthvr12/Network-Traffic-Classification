# Network-Traffic-Classification
Traffic classification is of great significance to 
network management. With the wide application of encryption 
technology, traditional traffic classification methods are no 
longer applicable. In recent years, the machine learning-based 
traffic classification method has become more and more popular. 
However, this method not only needs complex feature 
engineering but also is difficult to adapt to different network 
environments. A traffic classification method based on text 
convolution neural network is proposed in this paper, which 
represents traffic data as vectors, then use text convolution 
neural networks to extract key features for traffic classification. 
This method is validated on ISCX VPN-non VPN dataset and 
achieves better classification performance than the previous 
traffic classification method.
